# üì¶pycuga

Pycuga (PYthon CUda Genetic Algorithm) provides a simple and easy package for performing island-based genetic algorithm using Python and Cuda.

### ü¶æ Motivation
- When I worked on my prrevious project on Solving Maximum Satisfiability Problem using CUDA, I realised a lot of code could be reused and save a lot of development time for solving other optimisation problem using genetic algorithm and CUDA. 


## Parameters

| Methods currently supported |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Selection     | Elitism |
| Crossover     | Single, Double, Uniform |
| Mutation      | Number     |


```
pip install pycuga
```

```python
p1 = PyCUGA( mutationThreshold = 0.1, isTime = False, time = 0, constArr = "", chromosomeSize = 18432, evaluationString = "")
p1. launchKernel(islandSize = 32, blockSize = 128, chromosomeNo = 18432, migrationRounds = 20,rounds = 100)

```

## Limitations
* Use multiples of 32 (for chromosome parameters) to avoid bugs and increase efficiency.
* Island migration is limited to 1 item currently
* Lack unit testing


## ‚ùóDisclaimer
This is a mini project which I've put quite a lot of time and effort into, but I can't take responsibility for any bugs nor errors.
