## üì¶pycuga

Pycuga (PYthon CUda Genetic Algorithm) provides a package for performing island-based genetic algorithm on Python and CUDA.
- Methods for migartion, selection and mutation are implemented already. Users only need to pick the method during initialisation.
- User needs to define evaluation using Cuda code.

### Motivation
- When I worked on my previous project on [Solving Maximum Satisfiability Problem using CUDA](https://github.com/issacto/cuda-maxsat), I realised a lot of code could be reused, which save a lot of development time for solving other optimisation problems using genetic algorithm and CUDA. 


### Parameters

| Methods currently supported |  | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Selection     | Elitism, Roulette Wheel | 
| Crossover     | One (point), Two (points), Uniform|
| Mutation      | Number     |


```
pip install pycuga
```

```python
p1 = PyCUGA( isTime, time, constArr, chromosomeSize, stringPlaceholder, mutationNumber, selectionMode, crossoverMode)
p1. launchKernel(islandSize , blockSize , chromosomeNo, migrationRounds,rounds)
```

- constArr (numpy array):
- chromosomeSize (int):
- stringPlaceholder (string):
- mutationNumber (int):
- selectionMode (string):
- crossoverMode (string): "

- islandSize (int): size of an island
- blockSize (int): Cuda block size
- chromosomeNo (int): number of chromosomes
- migrationRounds (int): number of rounds per migration
- isTime (bool): stopped by time or number of rounds
- time (int): how many seconds allowed
- rounds (int): total number of rounds

### Limitations
* Use multiples of 32 (for chromosome parameters) to avoid bugs and increase efficiency.
* Island migration is limited to 1 item currently
* Lack unit testing


### ‚ùóDisclaimer
This is a mini project which I've put quite a lot of time and effort into, but I can't take responsibility for any bugs nor errors.
